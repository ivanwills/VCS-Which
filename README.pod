VCS-Which

This module lets you perform some basic operations with unknown version
control systems on a directory. The interface is still only at an early
stage but trys to harmonise differences between distributed and non-
distributed VCS's eg calling pull on on a non-distributed VCS will call
update instead.

The currently supported VCS's are GIT, SVN, CVS and Bazzar.
